# house-prediction
#Introduction
Predicting house prices is a common problem in the field of machine learning. This project aims to create a predictive model using historical house price data. The model will help in understanding the factors affecting house prices and assist in making informed decisions in the real estate market.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle. It contains various features like the number of rooms, lot size, year built, etc., along with the sale prices.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt. You can install them using the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone this repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Install the required libraries:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions:
bash
jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
or

bash
python house_price_prediction.py
Model
The project uses various regression models to predict house prices. The primary models explored are:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
The models are trained on the preprocessed dataset, and their performances are compared to select the best model.

Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score. These metrics help in understanding the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

Results
The final model selected is the Gradient Boosting Regressor, which provides the best performance among the models tested. The results and visualizations of the predictions are included in the Jupyter notebook.
